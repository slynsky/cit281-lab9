## Lab Purpose and Components
The task of lab 9 was to work through the “Create a release based workflow” lesson on GitHub.

## What I Learned
I think that this lab prepared me really well for project 7. Even though the tasks were pretty different, in both cases I was asked to use GitHub to perform a new task with some guidance, though some things that I just needed to figure out on my own through trial and error. It really helped me increase my comfort with the GitHub platform.
